    <p>
        Lefse is a Norwegian flatbread made with a few humble ingredients: potatoes, flour, salt and butter. Historically, potatoes first appeared in Norway around 250 years ago, and it’s likely that’s when Norwegian homesteaders started to make lefse in bulk as a tasty carbohydrate.
        <br><br>
        This Lefse recipe is handed down directly from the Lillehammer region Norway in the 1880s to the United States of America with an immigrant family. It is used as a holiday tradition for many Norwegian descendants, mainly on Christmas Eve.
        A very simple recipe of only four ingredients, people of all ages and creeds are able to make this treat with ease.

        Steps
    </h1>
        <ol>
            <h2><li>Make the Dough</li></h2>
                <p>First rice the potatoes. Then combine rice potatoes, butter, salt and flour to form a dough. Work ingredients by hand until well combined. Add more flour as needed, the dough should not stick to your hands.</p>
            <h2><li>Roll out the dough</li></h2>
                <p>Next measure out 1/3 cup of dough and roll it out very thin on a circular pastry cloth set on top of a large cutting board.</p>
            <h2><li>Cook lefse on the griddle</li></h2>
                <p>Turn on and heat griddle to 500F. Take the lefse sticks or another utensil to transfer lefse dough from the pastry cloth to the hot griddle. Cook each side for 1.5 minutes for a total of 3 minutes. Lefse should have golden-brown specs when done. </p>
            <h2><li>Set out lefse to cool</li></h2>
                <p>Once the lefse is fully cooked remove from griddle and put in a towel or lefse cozy until completely cool before serving.</p>
            <h2><li>Add cinnamon and sugar, fruit and yogurt etc</li></h2>
                <p>After the lefse have cooled they are ready for the last step, the toppings. The options here are endless. Peanut-butter and jelly, chicken and cheese, cinnamon and sugar or fruit and yogurt.</p>
        </ol>
