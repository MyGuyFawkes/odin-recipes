            all the water is absorbed.

        <li>
            Add one third of the milk and stir it in. Then cover your pot again and leave it until the consistency thickens and then add a little more milk every time the 
            consistency of the porridge thickens. you will likely have to do this approximately every five to ten minutes or so while still on low heat. you will need to 
            repeat this step until all the milk is used, the porridge is think, and the rice is tender. You  want his to look like the best fluffy riced pudding that has 
            ever been made. The entire process should take forty five to fifty five minutes. It might sound like a long time but its going to be well worth the wait!
