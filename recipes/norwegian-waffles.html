    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Norwegian waffles are a heart shaped special treat. They are deliciously eggy, with a hint of sweetness and vanilla flavor. It is essential if you want
        your waffles to be authentically Norwegian, they have to be:
        <ul>
            <li>Heart shaped</li>
            <li>Relatively thin</li>
            <li>Softer than classic American pancakes</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>3/4cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1/4cup greek yogurt</li>
        <li>1/2teaspoon quality vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/4cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>pinch of sea salt</li>
        <li>1tblspoon unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, beat the egg. Beat in the milk, yogurt and vanilla. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the dry ingredients, and slowly pour in the wet ingredients while whisking it so it just comes together. Pour in the melted butter.
            Whisk everything together until it is smooth, being carful not to over mix. Allow to sit for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, heat up your waffle iron. When you are ready, make sure your waffle iron is fully hot. Lightly brush the bottom and top with melted 
            butter. Gently scoop on the waffle batter, so it just covers the surface of the waffle iron. </li>
        <li>Close the lid and hold it down for about 30 seconds. Cook each waffle for several minutes. Repeat until all the batter is used.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately. The waffles will go soggy if you wait to eat them. Still delicious, but not as amazing.</li>
        <li>Top each waffle with a generous spoonful of Greek yogurt. Top with orange slices. Sprinkle with chopped pistachios. Drizzle honey over it all. ENJOY!</li>
